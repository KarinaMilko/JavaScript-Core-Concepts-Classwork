# JavaScript-Core-Concepts-Classwork

## **Project Goal**

To create a single, structured resource for reviewing the fundamental rules, syntax, and key concepts of the JavaScript language, from simple variables to advanced data structures and patterns.

## **Technologies & Content**

The repository contains individual files (`.js`) dedicated to each core JavaScript concept, facilitating the review of rules, examples, and practice exercises. Topics include:

* **Fundamentals:** Variables, Conditions, Loops, Functions (including arrow functions).

* **Data Structures:** Objects, Arrays, Maps, and Sets.

* **Advanced Concepts:** Closures, Destructuring, Classes, Recursion, Regular Expressions.

* **Modern JS:** Template Literals, Symbols, Error Handling, and Strict Mode.

## **Key Features**

* **Rules and Examples Focus:** Each file provides concise explanations of the rules alongside working code examples, serving as a digital conspectus.

* **Modular Structure:** Every topic is separated into its own file for maximum ease of study and review.

* **Practical Application:** Examples reflect common use cases in real-world development.
